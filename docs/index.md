# Get Healthy at Work

In regular jobs where we spend eight or more hours per day in an office, it's important to be aware of our daily basis habits. 
Over the years, I've seen friends with health problems - to name a few: back pains, kidney stone, varicose veins and repetitive strain injury (RSI) - that could be avoided if they were more careful about their health at work.

In this post I'll share some tips that I apply during my working hours. There's nothing new under the sun, but I hope this can be useful to put you in a good mood during your working day.
