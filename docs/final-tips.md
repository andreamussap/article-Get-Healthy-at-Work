# Small acts can make a big difference

I know that it’s not easy to practice all these things during a working day where we already have so many things to do, tasks to close, endless meetings to join, deadlines to meet, etc; but like I said in the beginning, if you have to go through all of this feeling ill you’ll have a miserable day. 

Therefore, start with small changes:

- To avoid or help with the repetitive strain injury (RSI) in the wrist, use a wrist exercise ball as much as you can during your day.
- If there isn’t standing desks at your office, get up from time to time to stretch and move all your body
- Take breaks to eat a snack and rest your eyes from the screen.
- Do a check up for dry eye disease (DED). You may never thought about it, but this is a modern lifestyle disease that anyone who uses digital devices for hours are subjected to have.
