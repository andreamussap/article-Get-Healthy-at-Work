# If it's out of sight, it's out of mind.

Sometimes we are so involved in a task that even if we remember that we are **thirsty**, we can't leave our desk before that thing is sorted out. This problem can be solved by keeping a bottle of water at your desk, so no matter how busy you are, you can always take 5 seconds to drink some water.

Oh! And if you will spend your day from one meeting to another, you should carry your bottle with you.
